# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed

**DevOps Engineer| Cloud | AI/ML Engineering**.  
I design, automate, and secure cloud infrastructure on **AWS**, and I'm actively building end-to-end projects that combine:

- Scalable cloud architectures (EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, DynamoDB)
- Infrastructure as Code & DevOps (Terraform, Kubernetes, GitHubActions)
- Modern data & AI/ML workflows (S3, Glue, Redshift, SageMaker, Python)

---

## 🧩 Featured Cloud & DevOps Skills

**Cloud Platforms**
- AWS: VPC, EC2, EKS, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, IAM, CloudWatch

**DevOps & Automation**
- Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize  
- Terraform, GitOps (Argo CD), GitHub Actions / GitLab CI  
- Monitoring & Logging: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana 

**Security & Reliability**
- IAM, least privilege, security groups, network segmentation  
- DevSecOps (image scanning, policy-as-code, compliance-like setups)  
- High availability, scaling, and resilience patterns

**Programming & Data**
- Python (automation, data processing, simple ML workflows)
- Bash scripting
- Basic SQL & data modeling concepts

### 🤖 Cloud + AI/ML Projects (In Progress / Planned)


- **[ML Pipeline on AWS (Data → Train → Deploy)](https://github.com/your-username/aws-ml-pipeline) – planned**  
  *End-to-end ML pipeline using S3, Glue or Lambda, SageMaker (or self-managed), and an API endpoint to serve predictions.*

- **[Real-time Data Processing with Stream + ML Inference](https://github.com/your-username/aws-realtime-ml) – planned**  
  *Ingest streaming data (Kinesis / Kafka), run lightweight ML inference, and push results to a dashboard or downstream system.*

- **[Cloud Cost Optimization & Rightsizing Project](https://github.com/your-username/aws-cost-optimization) – planned**  
  *Analyze AWS usage data, identify optimization opportunities, and automate some checks/alerts.*

## 🧠 How I approach projects

When I build a project, I focus on:

1. **Architecture first** – diagrams, components, and data flow  
2. **Infrastructure as Code** – everything reproducible (Terraform )
3. **CI/CD & automation** – no manual deployments  
4. **Security & reliability** – IAM, least privilege, logging, monitoring  
5. **Documentation** – clear README with:
   - Problem the project solves  
   - Design decisions  
   - Trade-offs and limitations  
   - Challenges I faced & how I fixed them
