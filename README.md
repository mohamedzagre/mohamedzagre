# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed

**Cloud & DevOps Engineer** transitioning into **Cloud + AI/ML Engineering**.  
I design, automate, and secure cloud infrastructure on **AWS**, and I'm actively building end-to-end projects that combine:

- Scalable cloud architectures (EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, DynamoDB)
- Infrastructure as Code & DevOps (Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Modern data & AI/ML workflows (S3, Glue, Redshift, SageMaker, Python)

---

## 🚀 What I'm focusing on right now

I'm currently going through a **Cloud & AI/ML projects program (Lucy’s course)** and building a series of hands-on projects around:

- **Cloud Engineering & Architecture on AWS**
- **Advanced AWS projects** (networking, security, serverless, containers)
- **Data & AI/ML pipelines** (data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, deployment)

Every serious project I build from this program will be pushed here to GitHub with:

- Clear architecture diagrams
- IaC (Terraform / CloudFormation where relevant)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Documentation on design decisions, trade-offs, and challenges

## 🧩 Featured Cloud & DevOps Skills

**Cloud Platforms**
- AWS: VPC, EC2, EKS, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, IAM, CloudWatch

**DevOps & Automation**
- Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize  
- Terraform, GitOps (Argo CD), GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Azure DevOps  
- Monitoring & Logging: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana (experience)

**Security & Reliability**
- IAM, least privilege, security groups, network segmentation  
- DevSecOps (image scanning, policy-as-code, compliance-like setups)  
- High availability, scaling, and resilience patterns

**Programming & Data**
- Python (automation, data processing, simple ML workflows)
- Bash scripting
- Basic SQL & data modeling concepts

## 📚 Project Portfolio (Cloud & AI/ML)

> These are or will be **real, multi-file projects** with documentation, not just hello-world demos.  
> I’m actively building and expanding this section as I complete projects.

### 🌩️ Cloud & DevOps Projects

- **[Secure E-Commerce Microservices on AWS EKS](https://github.com/your-username/secure-ecommerce-microservices-eks)**  
  *Microservices app running on EKS with Terraform, GitOps (Argo CD) and CI/CD.*  
  **Highlights:**  
  - EKS cluster with Terraform (VPC, node groups, networking)  
  - Containerized services (product, cart, order, payment)  
  - GitOps deployment with Argo CD  
  - Basic monitoring & logging integrated  
  - DevSecOps (image scanning, security best practices)

- **[Serverless Payment API with DevSecOps](https://github.com/your-username/serverless-payment-api)**  
  *API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB with CI/CD and security checks.*  
  **Highlights:**  
  - REST API with API Gateway + Lambda (Python or Node)  
  - DynamoDB for storing payments/transactions  
  - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) with tests + linting + security scan  
  - Proper IAM roles, environment variables, secrets handling

- **[AWS Landing Zone with Terraform](https://github.com/your-username/aws-landing-zone-terraform)**  
  *Multi-account AWS baseline for workloads: networking, security, and guardrails.*  
  **Highlights:**  
  - Multi-account structure (prod, non-prod)  
  - Centralized networking, logging, and IAM  
  - SCPs, IAM roles, and baseline security

> 🔜 More “Lucy course” cloud projects coming here soon, as I complete them.

### 🤖 Cloud + AI/ML Projects (In Progress / Planned)

> These will be based on projects from my Cloud & AI/ML program.

- **[ML Pipeline on AWS (Data → Train → Deploy)](https://github.com/your-username/aws-ml-pipeline) – planned**  
  *End-to-end ML pipeline using S3, Glue or Lambda, SageMaker (or self-managed), and an API endpoint to serve predictions.*

- **[Real-time Data Processing with Stream + ML Inference](https://github.com/your-username/aws-realtime-ml) – planned**  
  *Ingest streaming data (Kinesis / Kafka), run lightweight ML inference, and push results to a dashboard or downstream system.*

- **[Cloud Cost Optimization & Rightsizing Project](https://github.com/your-username/aws-cost-optimization) – planned**  
  *Analyze AWS usage data, identify optimization opportunities, and automate some checks/alerts.*

As I complete each of these, I’ll:
- Add full code and IaC
- Document the architecture
- Explain challenges I faced and how I solved them (useful for interviews)

## 🧠 How I approach projects

When I build a project, I focus on:

1. **Architecture first** – diagrams, components, and data flow  
2. **Infrastructure as Code** – everything reproducible (Terraform / CloudFormation)  
3. **CI/CD & automation** – no manual deployments  
4. **Security & reliability** – IAM, least privilege, logging, monitoring  
5. **Documentation** – clear README with:
   - Problem the project solves  
   - Design decisions  
   - Trade-offs and limitations  
   - Challenges I faced & how I fixed them (for interview conversations)

This makes it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to verify that I actually understand what I’ve built.

## 📈 Learning Roadmap (2025)

- Deepen AWS Cloud Engineering & Architecture skills  
- Build multiple end-to-end **Cloud + AI/ML** projects  
- Strengthen Python for automation and ML  
- Improve design of production-grade architectures (security, scaling, costs)
